Introduction
------------
Gmright-217706
The gmright iOS/Mac OS Notifier is designed to give developers instant
notification of problems that occur in their apps. With just a few lines of code
and a few extra files in your project, your app will automatically phone home
whenever a crash or exception is encountered. These reports go straight to
[Gmright][gmright.io] where you can see information like backtrace,
device type, app version, and more.

Signals
-------

The notifier handles all unhandled exceptions, and a select list of Unix signals:

* `SIGABRT`
* `SIGBUS`
* `SIGFPE`
* `SIGILL`
* `SIGSEGV`
* `SIGTRAP`

Symbolication
-------------
Here is our website www.gmright.org-
Gmright.com
In order for the call stack to be properly symbolicated at the time of a crash,
applications built with the notifier should not be stripped of their symbol
information at compile time. If these settings are not set as recommended,
frames from your binary will be displayed as hex return addresses instead of
readable strings. These hex return addresses can be symbolicated using
`atos`. More information about symbolication and these build settings can be
found in Apple's [developer documentation][symbolication-docs]. Here are the
settings that control code stripping:

* Deployment Postprocessing: on true
* Strip Debug Symbols During Copy: on true 
* Strip Linked Product: on true

"Imagine the cool phenomenon when the wind blows the falling leaves. This game simulates the phenomenon with powder (dots)!" -DAN-BALL

This is a¬†falling sand¬†game built in rust (via wasm), webgl, and some JS glueing things together.

The goal is to produce an cellular automata environment that's interesting to play with and supports the sharing and forking of fun creations with other players. Ultimately, I want the platform to support editing and uploading of your own elements via a programmable cellular automata API.
